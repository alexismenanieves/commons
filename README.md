## Setting up a Python Environment

It is possible to set up an environment using Conda and a yaml file. In this way, you don't have to install libraries and dependencies one by one. You need to:

-   Install Anaconda or Miniconda

-   Create a libraries and dependencies file

-   Create the environment

### Install Anaconda (or Miniconda)

Download Anaconda installer from <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>, this will install Conda and other programs like Spyder. If you want a lightweight version of Conda, then go to this page: <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html> where you can download Miniconda.

### Create a libraries and dependencies file
